ExpenseMate

ExpenseMate is a web application designed to simplify the process of managing and settling shared expenses within groups. It’s perfect for traveling friends, roommates splitting household costs, or any group event requiring clear expense tracking and fair settlement calculations.

Overview

What does ExpenseMate do?
	•	Create and Manage Groups: Start by creating a group for a single event (e.g., “Spain Trip 2024”).
	•	Add Members: Easily add friends to the group so everyone can participate.
	•	Record Expenses: Any member can log expenses, specifying how the cost is split—either equally by default or custom amounts per member.
	•	Automated Settlements: At the end of the event, ExpenseMate automatically computes who owes whom, minimizing the number of required transactions.
	•	Manual Payments: ExpenseMate displays each payee’s bank details for easy external transfers.
